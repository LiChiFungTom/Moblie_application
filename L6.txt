1. React vs React Native
    React 
        - A JavaScript library which is responsible for building a 
          hierarchy of UI components
    
    React Native
        - Based on React
            A JavaScript framework for writing real, natively rendering
            Android and IOS applications 
    
    MVC is a popular software architecture pattern for designing mobile applications
        - model
            The object that holds your application data and defines how to
            manipulate it
        
        - View 
            The objects that are in charge of the visual respresentation of the
            Model and the controls the user can interact with

        - Controller
            The controller is the mediator that coordinates all the work

        - Expo CLI

2. List the three basic concepts of React Native 
    - components
        components are reusable and can be used in anywhere in user interface
    - Props 
        The idea behind props is that you can make a single component that can
        be used in different places in your app
    - State
        there is data that should support dynamically change within a component during
        the lifetime of the app, state can be used


Props:
    Conclusion
        - With props, UI components such as "Text","Image", and "View" components,
        a wide variety of static screens can be built

        - However, to make the app change over time, you need to use"State"

State:
    There are two type of ata that control a conponent:
        Props:
            Props are set by the parent and they are fixed throughout the lifetime
            of a component
        State:
            For data that is able to be modified, we have to use state
    
    should support dynamically change within a component during the lifetime of the app
    ,state can be used


Props vs State
    Props
        - Varibales
        - Read-only
    
    State
        - Also variable
        - allow to be change by component in response to user action,network responses
