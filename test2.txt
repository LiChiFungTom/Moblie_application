Hybrid App development:

1. WebView app (run it in WebView and open APIs wiht JavaScript)
    The HTML,CSS and JavaScript code base runs in an 
    internal browser(call WebView)that is wrapped in 
    a native app Some native APIs are exposed to JavaScript
    through this wrapper e.g Cordova,Trigger.io

2. Compiled hybrid app (支持this 2 type language)
    The code is written in one language(C# or JavaScript)
    and gets compiled to native code for each supported
    platform

Hybrid Mobile App vs Mobile Website

Advantage:
    - Advanced offline capabilities
    
    - Native access to some device and operating system features

Disadvantage:
    - Maintainability
        Not always up-to-date as need to update installation on device

Apache Cordova:
    Cordova is an open source hybrid mobile development framework

Advantage:
    - Enables developers to use HTML,CSS,JavaScript skill sets to create a mobile application
    - Greatly speed up the development time

Disadvantage:
    - WebView application is slower in performance consideration than native applications

hybrid Mobile App vs Native App:

Advantage:
    - Developer can user existing web skills
        One code base for multiple platforms
        Reduced development time and cost

Disadvantage:
    Not all device and native features(fully) 
    


3. installed for using Cordova to develop mobile applications
that executes on Android platform :
    - Node.js

    - Android SDKs

    - Cordova CLI(still need SDKs of android SDk and IOS SDK)

NPM :
    - is a installed on your computer whten you install Node.js
    
NPM consists of three distinct components:
    - Npm Website
        use the website to discover packages, set up profiles, manage other
        aspects of your npm
    
    - Command Line Interface
        the CLI runs from a terminal, and interact with npm

    - Registry
        the registry is a large public database of JavaScript software

    Package:
        package in Node.js is a folder that contains all the
        necrssary file and described by a file "package.json"
    
    Module:
        Modules are JavaScript libraries that can perform specific functionalities

 4. Cordova Plugins
    Cordova essentially wraps a WebView of your HTML, CSS and JavaScript in a
    native application
        - the application does not support many device features

5. React Native
    Only JavaScript is required during the development Not HTML and CSS

Advantages
    - JavaScript
        You can use the existing JavaScript knowledge to build native mobile apps
    
    - Native components
        React Native apps look,feelm and perform like other platforms specific apps
    
    - Code sharing
        You can share most of your code on different platforms

    - Community
        The Community around React and React Native is large, and
        you will able to find solution that you need

6. React vs React Native
    React 
        - A JavaScript library which is responsible for building a 
          hierarchy of UI components
    
    React Native
        - Based on React
            A JavaScript framework for writing real, natively rendering
            Android and IOS applications 
    
    MVC is a popular software architecture pattern for designing mobile applications
        - model
            The object that holds your application data and defines how to
            manipulate it
        
        - View 
            The objects that are in charge of the visual respresentation of the
            Model and the controls the user can interact with

        - Controller
            The controller is the mediator that coordinates all the work

    React Natie Projcet Creation 
        - React Native CLI
        - Expo CLI

7. List the three basic concepts of React Native 
    - components
        components are reusable and can be used in anywhere in user interface
    - Props 
        The idea behind props is that you can make a single component that can
        be used in different places in your app
    - State
        there is data that should support dynamically change within a component during
        the lifetime of the app, state can be used

Props vs State
    Props
        - Varibales
        - Read-only
    
    State
        - Also variable
        - allow to be change by component in response to user action,network responses
