Hybrid App development:

1. WebView app (run it in WebView and open APIs wiht JavaScript)
    The HTML,CSS and JavaScript code base runs in an 
    internal browser(call WebView)that is wrapped in 
    a native app Some native APIs are exposed to JavaScript
    through this wrapper e.g Cordova,Trigger.io

2. Compiled hybrid app (支持this 2 type language)
    The code is written in one language(C# or JavaScript)
    and gets compiled to native code for each supported
    platform

Hybrid Mobile App vs Mobile Website

    - Native access to some device and operating system features

Disadvantage:
    - Maintainability
        Not always up-to-date as need to update installation on device

hybrid Mobile App vs Native App:

Advantage:
    - Developer can user existing web skills
        One code base for multiple platforms
        Reduced development time and cost

Disadvantage:
    Not all device and native features(fully) 
    


3. installed for using Cordova to develop mobile applications
that executes on Android platform :
    - Node.js

    - Android SDKs

    - Cordova CLI(still need SDKs of android SDk and IOS SDK)

NPM :
    - is a installed on your computer whten you install Node.js
    
NPM consists of three distinct components:
    - Npm Website
        use the website to discover packages, set up profiles, manage other
        aspects of your npm
    
    - Command Line Interface
        the CLI runs from a terminal, and interact with npm

    - Registry
        the registry is a large public database of JavaScript software

    Package:
        package in Node.js is a folder that contains all the
        necrssary file and described by a file "package.json"
    
    Module:
        Modules are JavaScript libraries that can perform specific functionalities
